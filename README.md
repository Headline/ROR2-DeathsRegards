# Death's Regards
The lord death himself gives you his regards. You've cheated him once and now you can do it again.

The item is locked behind an achievement that requires you to cheat death using Dio's Best Friend. If this annoys you, type !regardsunlock in chat during game to be a dirty cheater.
